 It's been a long day without you my friend And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again We've come a long way from where we began Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again When I see you again Who knew all the planes we flew, good things we've been through That I'll be standing right here talking to you about another tap I know we love to hit the road and laugh But something told me that the puttin' last had to switch up Look at things different, see the bigger picture Those were the days, hard work for ever pays Now I see you in a better place See you in a better place Ah, how can we not talk about family? We families all that we got Everything I would do you was standing there by my side And now you've got me with me for the last week
