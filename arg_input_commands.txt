python main.py --n_labels 7 --lyrics "I've been tryna call     
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals    
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby"

python main.py --lyrics "I'm scared, of the mountain           
Of the river, of the fire
Of the sound of lightning in the sky
Those sounds make me wanna cry"

python main.py --lyrics "I hope some day you'll join us. And the world will be as one"

python main.py --lyrics "Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you                                                              
We spent the late nights making things right between us
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh 
But now it's all good, babe          
Roll that back wood, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun and, yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah"

python main.py --lyrics "Once upon a time
There lived a ghost
He was known to be a killer
And feared the most
The eagle is comin'
You better start runnin'
His blood is rushin'
Stunnin' and gunnin'
The eagle is comin'
You better start runnin'
His blood is rushin'
Stunnin' and gunnin'
Once upon a time
There lived a ghost
He was known to be a killer
And feared the most
